<h1>Counter Blox Script - Legitbot, Ragebot, ESP, More</h1>

Numerous Roblox game modes closely mirror well-known titles, such as *Roblox Counter Blox*, a direct adaptation of *CS:GO* that faithfully replicates its core mechanics while introducing unique enhancements. Launched in 2014, the mode has evolved significantly over time, allowing players to align with either terrorists or counter-terrorists and engage in combat using a starter arsenal, with opportunities to unlock more powerful weapons through in-game currency. Despite its competitive framework, the mode is not immune to exploits; one widely circulated cheat, accessible for free at *cheater.fun*, offers players an array of advantages, including ESP, Aimbot, and other features designed to dominate opponents.
